**The use of this software subjects you to our** [**Terms Of Use**][3] **and** [**Data Protection Policy**][4]

# version [0.0.6][5]

## Introduction:

**gContactOOo** is part of a [Suite][6] of [LibreOffice][7] and/or [OpenOffice][8] extensions allowing to offer you innovative services in these office suites.  
This extension gives you access to your phone contacts in LibreOffice / OpenOffice (the contacts of your Android phone).

Being free software I encourage you:
- To duplicate its [source code][9].
- To make changes, corrections, improvements.
- To open [issue][10] if needed.

In short, to participate in the development of this extension.  
Because it is together that we can make Free Software smarter.

## Requirement:

gContactOOo uses a local [HsqlDB][11] database version 2.7.1.  
HsqlDB being a database written in Java, its use requires the [installation and configuration][12] in LibreOffice / OpenOffice of a **JRE version 11 or later**.  
I recommend [Adoptium][13] as your Java installation source.

If you are using **LibreOffice on Linux**, then you are subject to [bug 139538][14].  
To work around the problem, please uninstall the packages:
- libreoffice-sdbc-hsqldb
- libhsqldb1.8.0-java

If you still want to use the Embedded HsqlDB functionality provided by LibreOffice, then install the [HsqlDBembeddedOOo][15] extension.  
OpenOffice and LibreOffice on Windows are not subject to this malfunction.

## Installation:

It seems important that the file was not renamed when it was downloaded.
If necessary, rename it before installing it.

- Install ![OAuth2OOo logo][16] **[OAuth2OOo.oxt][17]** extension version 0.0.6.

You must install this extension, if it is not already installed.

- Install ![jdbcDriverOOo logo][18] **[jdbcDriverOOo.oxt][19]** extension version 0.0.4.

You must install this extension, if it is not already installed.

- Install ![gContactOOo logo][1] **[gContactOOo.oxt][20]** extension version 0.0.6.

Restart LibreOffice / OpenOffice after installation.

## Use:

In LibreOffice / OpenOffice go to File -> Wizards -> Address Data Source...:

![gContactOOo screenshot 1][21]

In step: 1. Address Book Type:
- select: Other external data source
- click on: Next(Button)

![gContactOOo screenshot 2][22]

In step: 2. Connection Settings:
- click on: Settings(Button)

![gContactOOo screenshot 3][23]

In Database type list:
- select: Google Contacts
- click on: Next(Button)

![gContactOOo screenshot 4][24]

In General: Datasource Url:
- put: your Google account (ie: your_account@gmail.com)

Then:
- click on: Test connection (button)

![gContactOOo screenshot 5][25]

After authorizing the [OAuth2OOo][26] application to access your Contacts, normally you should see: Connection Test: The connection was established successfully.

## Historical:

### Introduction:

This extension was written in order to make usable in free software (LibreOffice or OpenOffice) your personal data (your address book) stored in your Android phone.

With the [smtpMailerOOo][28] extension, it can be the data source for [mail merge][29] by email, to your correspondents contained in your phone.

It will give you access to an information system that only larges companies are able, today, to implement.

### What has been done for version 0.0.5:

- Integration and use of the new Hsqldb v2.5.1.

- Writing of a new [Replicator][30] interface, launched in the background (python Thread) responsible for:

    - Perform the necessary procedures when creating a new user (initial Pull).

- Writing of a new [DataBase][31] interface, responsible for making all calls to the database.

- Many other fix...

### What has been done for version 0.0.6:

- Driver has a new name: **Google Contacts**

- Driver is now registred for a new protocol: **sdbc:address:google:your_account@gmail.com**

- The [jdbcDriverOOo][19] extension now provides the driver needed to access the HsqlDB database used by gContactOOo.

- Modifying the [Replicator][30] in order to: 
    - Open and close the database at each replication.
    - Go on hold after the last closing of the address book.
    - Unload when closing LibreOffice / OpenOffice.

- Possibility to open the local HsqlDB database by: **Tools -> Options -> Internet -> gContactOOo -> View DataBase**

- Many other fix...

### What remains to be done for version 0.0.6:

- Make the address book locally editable with replication of changes.

- Add new languages for internationalization...

- Anything welcome...
