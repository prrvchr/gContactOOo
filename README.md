# version [0.0.6](https://prrvchr.github.io/gContactOOo#historical)

## Introduction:

**gContactOOo** is part of a [Suite](https://prrvchr.github.io/) of [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/) and/or [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/download/index.html) extensions allowing to offer you innovative services in these office suites.  
This extension gives you access to your phone contacts in LibreOffice / OpenOffice (the contacts of your Android phone).

Being free software I encourage you:
- To duplicate its [source code](https://github.com/prrvchr/gContactOOo).
- To make changes, corrections, improvements.
- To open [issue](https://github.com/prrvchr/gContactOOo/issues/new) if needed.

In short, to participate in the development of this extension.  
Because it is together that we can make Free Software smarter.

## Requirement:

gContactOOo uses a local [HsqlDB](http://hsqldb.org/) database version 2.5.1.  
HsqlDB being a database written in Java, its use requires the [installation and configuration](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/HowTo/Install_the_correct_JRE_-_LibreOffice_on_Windows_10) in LibreOffice / OpenOffice of a **JRE version 11 or later**.  
I recommend [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11) as your Java installation source.

If you are using **LibreOffice on Linux**, then you are subject to [bug 139538](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139538).  
To work around the problem, please uninstall the packages:
- libreoffice-sdbc-hsqldb
- libhsqldb1.8.0-java

If you still want to use the Embedded HsqlDB functionality provided by LibreOffice, then install the [HsqlDBembeddedOOo](https://prrvchr.github.io/HsqlDBembeddedOOo/) extension.  
OpenOffice and LibreOffice on Windows are not subject to this malfunction.

## Installation:

It seems important that the file was not renamed when it was downloaded.
If necessary, rename it before installing it.

- Install ![OAuth2OOo logo](https://prrvchr.github.io/OAuth2OOo/img/OAuth2OOo.png) **[OAuth2OOo.oxt](https://github.com/prrvchr/OAuth2OOo/raw/master/OAuth2OOo.oxt)** extension version 0.0.5.

You must install this extension, if it is not already installed.

- Install ![jdbcDriverOOo logo](https://prrvchr.github.io/jdbcDriverOOo/img/jdbcDriverOOo.png) **[jdbcDriverOOo.oxt](https://github.com/prrvchr/jdbcDriverOOo/raw/master/jdbcDriverOOo.oxt)** extension version 0.0.4.

## Historical:

### Introduction:

This extension was written in order to make usable in free software (LibreOffice or OpenOffice) your personal data (your address book) stored in your Android phone.

With the [smtpMailerOOo](https://github.com/prrvchr/smtpMailerOOo/blob/master/smtpMailerOOo.oxt) extension, it can be the data source for [mail merge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_merge) by email, to your correspondents contained in your phone.

It will give you access to an information system that only larges companies are able, today, to implement.

### What has been done for version 0.0.5:

- Integration and use of the new Hsqldb v2.5.1.

- Writing of a new [Replicator](https://github.com/prrvchr/gContactOOo/blob/master/CloudContactOOo/python/cloudcontact/replicator.py) interface, launched in the background (python Thread) responsible for:

    - Perform the necessary procedures when creating a new user (initial Pull).

- Writing of a new [DataBase](https://github.com/prrvchr/gContactOOo/blob/master/CloudContactOOo/python/cloudcontact/database.py) interface, responsible for making all calls to the database.

- Many other fix...

### What has been done for version 0.0.6:

- Driver has a new name: **Google Contacts**

- Driver is now registred for a new protocol: **sdbc:address:google:your_account@gmail.com**

- The [jdbcDriverOOo](https://github.com/prrvchr/jdbcDriverOOo/raw/master/jdbcDriverOOo.oxt) extension now provides the driver needed to access the HsqlDB database used by gContactOOo.

- Modifying the [Replicator](https://github.com/prrvchr/gContactOOo/blob/master/CloudContactOOo/python/cloudcontact/replicator.py) in order to: 
    - Open and close the database at each replication.
    - Go on hold after the last closing of the address book.
    - Unload when closing LibreOffice / OpenOffice.

- Possibility to open the local HsqlDB database by: Tools -> Options -> Internet -> gContactOOo -> View DataBase

- Many other fix...

### What remains to be done for version 0.0.6:

- Make the address book locally editable with replication of changes.

- Add new languages for internationalization...

- Anything welcome...
